    OnlyDevs: Made for devs, by devs.
 </h2>

Onlydevs is a web application designed with the purpose of helping devlopers get noticed by potential employers in the industry by showcasing their skills.
It's goal is to streamline the application process and make it more meaningfull than just cold-applying to jobs only to get ghosted.
The application is designed not only just for developers but also for recruiters and companies to find potential canidates that meet their requirments quickly.


## Work in progress

Please keep in mine that this application is being created by a small team of developers so features may come out slowly or far in between. However, we are dedicated in what we do so if there are any issues please make an issue post on github and we will try to get it fixed as fast as we can!

## To do

- Create a landing page
- Allow developers to create profiles
- Incorporate resume/application managment
- Impelment messaging between users and the ability to create group chats
